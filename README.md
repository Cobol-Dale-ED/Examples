# COBOL Examples 
This is a collection of example and test COBOL programs I've written while experiementing with the language features and syntaxes.

All program were written using [GNU COBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) in Linux. These were all written, more or less, as simple "scratch pad" applications 
for myself. They aren't intended to be a tutorial or instructional on "best practices". Hopefully though someone 
finds some of this useful as finding simple COBOL examples can sometimes be hard when searching the internet. 

This repo will be updated from time to time depending on when I decide to try out some syntax or feature (that's
 potentially worth sharing).
